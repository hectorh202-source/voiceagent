# The `/settings` app

This doc covers the web app at `/settings` — routes, auth flow, and how form saves work. For how the data underneath it is actually stored/encrypted, see [sqlite-storage.md](sqlite-storage.md); this doc is about the app layer built on top of that storage.

## Why this exists

The platform needs credentials for ElevenLabs and ServiceTitan, plus a couple of operational values (an emergency transfer number, a shared secret for tool auth). Rather than a `.env` file, these are entered through a small password-protected web UI and stored encrypted in the local database. This was a deliberate project requirement: no credential should live in code or in an env file on disk, since the server is routinely exposed to the public internet (via ngrok in dev, or a real domain in production), and a login-gated UI backed by encrypted storage was judged a better fit than a plaintext `.env` file sitting in the deployed code.

## Routes

Split across two routers — a global one and a per-business one, reflecting the platform's multi-business model (see [architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md)).

**Global**, defined in [`src/settings/routes.ts`](../src/settings/routes.ts), mounted at `/settings` in `index.ts`:

| Route | Method | Auth required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/settings/setup` | GET, POST | none (only reachable if zero users exist yet) | First-run: create the first platform account (email + password) — always created as a platform admin |
| `/settings/migrate` | GET, POST | none (only reachable for an upgraded install with a legacy password and zero users) | One-time: convert the old single admin password into the first real account — always created as a platform admin |
| `/settings/login` | GET, POST | none | Log in with email + password |
| `/settings/logout` | POST | admin session | Destroy the session |
| `/settings` | GET | admin session + **platform admin** | Render the business list + "Add business" form + Users section (a non-admin is redirected to `/app` instead) |
| `/settings/businesses` | POST | admin session + platform admin | Create a business, redirect to its `/app/:id/settings/business-info` |
| `/settings/users` | POST | admin session + platform admin | Add a new platform user (email + password + optional platform-admin flag + business assignment) |
| `/settings/users/:id/access` | POST | admin session + platform admin | Update an *existing* user's platform-admin flag and/or business assignments |
| `/settings/users/:id/delete` | POST | admin session + platform admin | Remove a platform user (not yourself) |

**Per-business credentials now live in the React SPA, not a server-rendered form.** The old `src/settings/businessRoutes.ts` (server-rendered `GET`/`POST /b/:businessId/settings`) was deleted once the SPA covered the same functionality — this platform's business-scoped settings UI is `client/`'s `BusinessInfoSettingsPage`/`GeneralSettingsPage`, served at `/app/:businessId/settings/business-info` and `/app/:businessId/settings/general`, talking to a JSON API instead of posting an HTML form:

| Route | Method | Auth required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/businesses/:businessId/settings/business-info` | GET, PUT | API session + valid business | Business name, default ServiceTitan business unit/campaign/job type IDs, service categories |
| `/api/businesses/:businessId/settings/general` | GET, PUT | API session + valid business | ElevenLabs/ServiceTitan credentials & environment, tag name, booking mode, operational settings |
| `/api/businesses/:businessId/settings/general/generate-secret` | POST | API session + valid business | Generate + save a new random tool webhook secret for that business |

These live in `src/api/businessRouter.ts`, gated by `requireApiSession` (`src/api/requireApiSession.ts`) — the same session check as `requireAdminSession` below, just responding `401` JSON instead of redirecting, since the caller is the SPA's `fetch()`, not a browser navigation.

Every `/b/:businessId/*` route (the ElevenLabs tool webhooks, the post-call webhook, and the public call-detail dashboard) and every `/api/businesses/:businessId/*` route sits behind [`src/middleware/resolveBusiness.ts`](../src/middleware/resolveBusiness.ts). It parses `:businessId`, looks up the business, and 404s immediately if it's not a valid positive integer or doesn't match a real business — before any auth/secret check downstream even runs, so an invalid business ID never leaks a confusing 401/503 for something that doesn't exist. One easy-to-miss Express detail that bit this during development: a child `Router()` mounted at a path containing `:businessId` **must** be created with `Router({ mergeParams: true })`, or it gets its own empty `req.params` scope and `resolveBusiness` never sees `:businessId` at all.

### First-run vs. migration vs. normal flow

`getAuthState()` in `auth.ts` is the single source of truth every entry point branches on:

```
getAuthState():
  users table has any rows?      → "ready"
  else: legacy admin.passwordHash setting exists?  → "needs_migration"
  else                                              → "fresh"

GET /settings (and every other gated route)
  → "fresh"           → redirect to /settings/setup     (create first account)
  → "needs_migration" → redirect to /settings/migrate    (upgrade old password into an account)
  → "ready"           → requireAdminSession → render the settings form
```

`/settings/setup` and `/settings/migrate` are both effectively one-time routes — once `getAuthState()` returns `"ready"`, hitting either one just redirects to `/settings/login` instead of re-running first-run setup.

## Multi-user auth

The app moved from a single shared admin password to real per-user accounts (`src/db/users.ts`, table `users` — email, scrypt password hash/salt, failed-attempt/lockout counters), orchestrated by a thin [`src/settings/auth.ts`](../src/settings/auth.ts) and enforced by [`src/middleware/requireAdminSession.ts`](../src/middleware/requireAdminSession.ts).

- **Password check**: same primitive as before — Node's built-in `scrypt` (random salt, `timingSafeEqual` comparison) — now scoped per user row instead of one global setting. See [sqlite-storage.md](sqlite-storage.md#admin-password-hashed-not-encrypted) for the hashing detail (still accurate, just applied per-user now).
- **Session check**: `requireAdminSession` stores `req.session.userId` (not a boolean) and re-validates it against the `users` table on *every* request — so deleting a user immediately kills their live session rather than waiting for their next login attempt.
- **Brute-force protection**, entirely in `db/users.ts`'s `attemptLogin()`:
  - Per-account lockout: 5 wrong passwords locks that account for 15 minutes (`locked_until`, persisted in SQLite — survives a restart, same as sessions).
  - A dummy `scrypt` hash is computed even when the submitted email doesn't match any user, so a nonexistent-email attempt costs the same time as a real one — avoids leaking account existence via response timing.
  - Login failures always render the identical message, `"Invalid email or password."`, whether the email doesn't exist, the password is wrong, or the account is currently locked — a locked-out admin isn't told why (see [Removing a user](#removing-a-user) below for how to clear a lockout directly).
  - Separately, [`src/middleware/loginRateLimiter.ts`](../src/middleware/loginRateLimiter.ts) throttles by IP (20 failed attempts / 15 min, in-memory — intentionally not persisted, since only the per-account lockout needs to survive a restart). Requires `app.set("trust proxy", 1)` in `index.ts` so `req.ip` reflects the real client through Caddy rather than its internal address.

### Upgrading an existing deployment

An already-running instance has a legacy `admin.passwordHash`/`admin.passwordSalt` in the `settings` table and no `users` rows yet. After deploying this change, the admin is redirected to `/settings/migrate`: entering the *current* password plus an email creates the first real user account (re-hashed fresh, not copying the old hash bytes) and deletes the legacy settings keys. The old password keeps working right up through that one migration step — there's no lockout risk during the upgrade.

Note that `/tools/*` (the ElevenLabs webhook endpoints) are a **completely separate auth mechanism** — a shared secret header, not a login session, since ElevenLabs' servers obviously can't fill out a login form. See [elevenlabs-tools.md](elevenlabs-tools.md).

### Server-side auth checks aren't enough on their own — the browser's back/forward cache

Found via real testing: logging out and back in as a different user in the *same browser tab*, then pressing the browser's **back** button, could show a previously-rendered authenticated page (e.g. the platform-admin `/settings` console) even though the current session belongs to a different, non-admin user. The cause isn't a bug in `requireAdminSession`/`requirePlatformAdmin` — those still run correctly on every real request. It's the browser's **back/forward cache (bfcache)**: modern browsers can restore a previously-rendered page (the full DOM, sometimes the whole JS heap) straight from memory when you navigate back, without ever asking the server again — so a per-request auth check simply never gets the chance to run.

Fixed in two layers:
1. **`src/middleware/noStore.ts`** — sets `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, private` + `Pragma: no-cache` on every authenticated response: all of `/settings/*`, `/api/*`, and the React SPA's HTML shell under `/app/*`. `no-store` is the one directive that reliably disqualifies a response from both the regular HTTP cache and bfcache in current browsers, forcing a real round-trip to the server (and therefore a fresh auth check) on every back/forward navigation. **A real gotcha hit while wiring this up**: `express.static(clientDistPath)` was serving `index.html` directly for a bare `GET /app` (its default directory-index behavior) — bypassing the `noStore`-guarded catch-all entirely, confirmed via a real request coming back `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0` instead of `no-store`. Fixed by mounting the static middleware with `{ index: false }`, forcing every request for the HTML shell through the catch-all that actually sets the header.
2. **A `pageshow` listener** (in `client/src/main.tsx` for the SPA, and inline in `settings/views.ts`'s shared `page()` wrapper for the server-rendered auth pages) that calls `window.location.reload()` whenever `event.persisted` is true. This is the belt-and-suspenders layer for browsers that might still bfcache a page despite `no-store` (Safari has historically been more permissive here than Chrome/Firefox) — a persisted-page restore forces an immediate real reload instead of silently continuing to show frozen, possibly stale-user state.

**What this doesn't fix, because it isn't a caching bug**: a browser's own saved-password autofill can still offer to fill a previously-used email/password into the login form — that's the browser's password manager working as designed (and deliberately hard for a site to suppress; `autocomplete="off"` is widely ignored by browsers on login forms for exactly this reason). Verified via a real repro of the reported scenario that the *page content itself* (the actual security concern — a stale authenticated console rendering for the wrong user) is fixed: after this change, repeatedly pressing back as a freshly-logged-in non-admin user always re-renders fresh from the server and correctly redirects away from `/settings`, rather than showing the previous session's cached page.

### Per-business access control — platform admins vs. scoped users

Every user is either a **platform admin** (`users.is_platform_admin`) or scoped to specific businesses via a `user_businesses` join table (`user_id, business_id`, simple membership — no per-business role tiers, just "has access" or doesn't). Platform admins bypass the membership table entirely and see/edit every business, exactly like every user did before this existed; a scoped (non-admin) user can only see and act on the businesses they're explicitly assigned to.

**Enforcement is deliberately narrow** — added in exactly two places, since most of this app's surfaces have their own unrelated auth already:
- **`src/middleware/requireBusinessAccess.ts`**, mounted on `src/api/businessRouter.ts` right after `resolveBusiness`/`requireApiSession` — every `/api/businesses/:businessId/*` call (calls, metrics, settings) 403s for a business the current user isn't assigned to. `GET /api/businesses` (the SPA's business switcher and `FirstBusinessRedirect`) is scoped the same way via `listBusinessesForUser()` — a scoped user simply never sees a business they don't have access to, no client-side filtering needed.
- **`src/middleware/requirePlatformAdmin.ts`**, on the global `/settings` console (business list, add/remove users, business/admin assignment) — a scoped user has no reason to see every business/user in the system, so hitting `/settings` redirects them straight to `/app` (which resolves to their own first assigned business).

`/b/:businessId/tools/*` and `/webhooks/*` (shared-secret auth, unrelated to user sessions) and the public `/b/:businessId/calls/:conversationId` page (deliberately unauthenticated) are untouched by any of this.

**Migration**: `src/db/migrateUserBusinessAccess.ts` marks every *existing* user a platform admin on deploy — zero surprise/lockout, matching the full access they already had. Only users created *after* this shipped default to scoped/non-admin. The very first account (via `/settings/setup` or `/settings/migrate`) is always created as a platform admin, since there's no one else yet to grant them access.

**Assigning access** happens on the same global `/settings` page, right where each user is already listed: a "Platform admin" checkbox plus one checkbox per business (checked = assigned), submitting to `POST /settings/users/:id/access`. The same two controls are on the "Add a user" form, so a new user can be scoped at creation time too. A user can't revoke their own platform-admin flag (mirrors the existing "can't delete your own account" guard) — the checkbox renders disabled for your own row, and the server rejects it too, to avoid a self-lockout with no one else able to restore access.

**A real bug caught during live testing**: `node:sqlite` enforces foreign keys by default, so `deleteUser()` on a scoped user with rows in `user_businesses` used to throw an unhandled `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` instead of removing them (the existing "Remove" button would have 500'd for any non-admin user). Fixed by having `deleteUser()` delete that user's `user_businesses` rows in the same transaction before deleting the user row itself.

### Removing a user

**Normal path**: log into `/settings`, find the user in the **Users** section, click **Remove**. You can't remove your own currently-logged-in account this way (`POST /settings/users/:id/delete` rejects it) — log in as a different user to remove one.

**If the UI isn't an option** (e.g. it's the only account, or you're locked out): edit the `users` table directly. On the VPS, following the same `docker compose exec app node -e "..."` one-off-script pattern used elsewhere in this project (e.g. for looking up ServiceTitan campaign/tag IDs):

```bash
docker compose exec app node -e "
  const { DatabaseSync } = require('node:sqlite');
  const db = new DatabaseSync('/data/app.db');
  console.log(db.prepare('SELECT id, email, locked_until FROM users').all());
"
# then, to remove one:
docker compose exec app node -e "
  const { DatabaseSync } = require('node:sqlite');
  const db = new DatabaseSync('/data/app.db');
  db.prepare('DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?').run(<id>);
"
```

The same technique clears a brute-force lockout early instead of waiting out the 15 minutes:

```bash
docker compose exec app node -e "
  const { DatabaseSync } = require('node:sqlite');
  const db = new DatabaseSync('/data/app.db');
  db.prepare('UPDATE users SET locked_until = NULL, failed_login_count = 0 WHERE email = ?').run('someone@example.com');
"
```

## How saving the form works

The React SPA's two settings pages each `PUT` their whole form to their respective `/api/businesses/:businessId/settings/*` endpoint in one request (see `src/api/businessRouter.ts`). Both handlers share one small helper, now living in `src/settings/store.ts` (moved there from the old `businessRoutes.ts` so both the API and any future caller can reuse it):

```ts
export function maybeSetBusinessSetting(businessId: number, key: string, value: string | undefined): void {
  const trimmed = value?.trim();
  if (trimmed) {
    setBusinessSetting(businessId, key, trimmed);
  }
}
```

Every secret/optional field goes through this: **if you left it blank, it's left alone in the database — not cleared.** This is why secret fields (API keys, client secret, tool webhook secret) show as empty password inputs with a placeholder like "(set — leave blank to keep)" rather than ever re-displaying the actual secret — you only need to type a new value when you actually want to change it.

The exception is `servicetitan.environment` (the Integration/Sandbox vs. Production dropdown) and a few other `<select>`-backed fields (booking mode), which are always written on every save, since a dropdown always submits *some* value — there's no "blank" state to distinguish from "user didn't touch this."

### The bug this design fixes

Earlier, the settings page read fields in groups through combined getters (e.g. one function that returned all ElevenLabs settings, or `null` if *any* of them was missing). That caused two real problems:
1. If you'd saved just one field in a group, the page would render the *whole group* as blank, because the combined getter refused to return anything unless every field in the group was present.
2. Saving a different field in the same group — with the actually-saved field's input left blank as "unchanged" — would go through the old combined *setter*, which used the (now-`null`) combined getter as its fallback for "keep the current value," silently writing an empty string over a real, already-saved secret.

The fix was moving to **per-field reads and writes** everywhere in the settings app (`getRawElevenLabsSettings(businessId)`, `getRawServiceTitanSettings(businessId)`, `getRawOperationalSettings(businessId)` in `store.ts`), so no field's fate depends on any other field's presence. The one place a strict "all-or-nothing" check still exists is `getServiceTitanConfig(businessId)` — but that's used only by the actual ServiceTitan API client, which genuinely can't function without every required credential, so gating there is correct rather than accidental. Full detail in [sqlite-storage.md](sqlite-storage.md#why-key-value-instead-of-typed-columns).

### Global settings vs. business settings

`src/settings/store.ts` has two parallel families of functions: `getSetting`/`setSetting`/`hasSetting`/`deleteSetting` operate on the `settings` table (only three keys ever live here: the session secret and the dormant legacy admin password), while `getBusinessSetting`/`setBusinessSetting`/`hasBusinessSetting`/`deleteBusinessSetting` operate on `business_settings`, keyed by `(business_id, key)`. Every ElevenLabs/ServiceTitan/Operational credential goes through the business-scoped versions — see [sqlite-storage.md](sqlite-storage.md) for the table shapes and why the split exists rather than one table with a sentinel "global" business ID.

## Flash messages

`req.session.flash` still carries one-time success/error messages for the remaining server-rendered global pages (setup/migrate/login/business-list) — `takeFlash()` in `routes.ts` reads it and immediately clears it. The two per-business settings pages no longer use this at all: they're React forms that show a save confirmation (or the newly-generated secret) directly from the `PUT`/`POST` response, no redirect involved.

## The rendered page itself

`src/settings/views.ts` still has no templating engine for what remains there — plain template-literal functions returning full HTML strings (`renderSetupPage`, `renderLoginPage`, `renderMigratePage`, `renderBusinessListPage`). The per-business credentials form (previously `renderSettingsPage()`) was deleted from this file — it's now `client/src/pages/BusinessInfoSettingsPage.tsx` and `GeneralSettingsPage.tsx`, real React components, part of the SPA described in [call-dashboard.md](call-dashboard.md#calls-section-react-spa) and [architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md).

## Guardrails against accidental edits

A few fields break things silently if changed by mistake (a stray click, a misplaced keystroke), with no server-side error to catch it — so the UI adds friction before it happens rather than relying on being careful. The mechanism changed with the SPA rewrite, but the same fields are guarded and the same reasoning applies:

- **`GeneralSettingsPage.tsx`'s `confirmCriticalChanges()`** runs before every save, comparing the current form values against what was loaded from the API — if **Agent ID**, **Tenant ID**, **Lead tag name**, or **Booking Mode** differ from their loaded value, a `window.confirm()` fires with the same wording the old server-rendered form used, one prompt per changed field. Declining any one aborts the save entirely (the mutation never fires). Unlike the old form, there's no separate "unlock" step before editing — the field is always editable, and the confirmation only fires at save time based on what actually changed.
- **"Generate a new secret"** (a link-styled button next to the Tool webhook secret field) still has no separate confirm of its own — clicking it immediately invalidates that business's current secret via `POST /api/businesses/:businessId/settings/general/generate-secret`, and every tool call for that business fails until the new one is copied into its ElevenLabs agent. Regenerating one business's secret has no effect on any other business's.

None of this is server-enforced; it's UI-only friction on top of the same `PUT /api/businesses/:businessId/settings/general` endpoint described above.

## Fields in the form, grouped

Split across the SPA's two settings pages (was one combined form before the rebuild) — every business configures these independently, with zero shared state between businesses:

| Page | Fields |
|---|---|
| **Business Info** (`/app/:businessId/settings/business-info`) | Business name, default ServiceTitan Business Unit ID / Campaign ID / Job Type ID, the 10-row service categories grid |
| **General** (`/app/:businessId/settings/general`) | ElevenLabs API key + Agent ID; ServiceTitan Environment, Client ID, Client secret, App key, Tenant ID, Call reason ID, Lead tag name, Booking mode; Operational timezone, Dashboard base URL, tool webhook secret, post-call webhook secret |

The split follows what each field is *for*: Business Info holds the values that map a call to the right ServiceTitan business unit/job type (the things a client themselves might reasonably tweak), while General holds credentials and lower-level operational config.

`operational.timezone` only affects how call times are formatted on that business's call-detail dashboard — it's deliberately unrelated to ElevenLabs' own per-agent time zone setting, which governs the agent's time-awareness *during* a call (greetings, business hours, relative dates). Changing one has no effect on the other; see [call-dashboard.md](call-dashboard.md) for detail.

See [servicetitan-integration.md](servicetitan-integration.md) for what the ServiceTitan fields are actually used for, and [elevenlabs-tools.md](elevenlabs-tools.md) for the operational fields' role in tool auth.

## Businesses

Every business is one row in the `businesses` table (`src/db/businesses.ts` — `id`, `name`, `created_at`; see [sqlite-storage.md](sqlite-storage.md)). `id` is the value used everywhere in URLs (`/b/:businessId/...`, `/app/:businessId/...`) — there's no separate slug, so renaming a business (`renameBusiness()`) never breaks a URL or a link already pasted into ServiceTitan. The business's `name` is shown publicly on its call-detail dashboard (see [call-dashboard.md](call-dashboard.md)) and in the SPA's sidebar business switcher, so a typo made when adding one is worth fixing rather than living with — **renaming is now possible directly through the UI**: the "Business name" field on the Business Info settings page (`/app/:businessId/settings/business-info`) saves via `PUT /api/businesses/:businessId/settings/business-info`, calling `renameBusiness()` under the hood. (No `docker compose exec` needed for this anymore — that direct-DB pattern is still the way to fix anything not exposed in either settings page.)

**Deleting a business is not built** — it would cascade across that business's `business_settings`, `call_log`, `elevenlabs_calls` rows, and its on-disk call recordings, and a half-finished cascade is a worse failure mode than just not offering the button yet. If one ever needs decommissioning, do it by hand via the same direct-DB pattern, deleting from each table in turn.
